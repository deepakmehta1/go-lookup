# Go Concurrency Patterns

This repository contains examples of the four foundational concurrency patterns implemented in Go. These patterns help manage concurrent programming tasks efficiently by coordinating multiple goroutines.

## Patterns Overview

1. **Single Producer, Single Consumer**
   - **Description:** A single producer generates data that is consumed by a single consumer.
   - **Example:** A logging system where log messages are generated by a single component and processed by a logger.
   - **Link to Code:** [logging.go](https://github.com/deepakmehta1/go-lookup/blob/main/concurrency/patterns/logging.go)

2. **Single Producer, Multiple Consumers**
   - **Description:** A single producer generates data distributed to multiple consumers.
   - **Example:** A web server routing incoming requests to a pool of workers.
   - **Link to Code:** [workers_pool.go](https://github.com/deepakmehta1/go-lookup/blob/main/concurrency/patterns/workers_pool.go)

3. **Multiple Producers, Single Consumer**
   - **Description:** Multiple producers generate data that is aggregated by a single consumer.
   - **Example:** Multiple sensors sending data to a central server for aggregation.
   - **Link to Code:** [data_aggregator.go](https://github.com/deepakmehta1/go-lookup/blob/main/concurrency/patterns/data_aggregator.go)

4. **Multiple Producers, Multiple Consumers**
   - **Description:** Multiple producers generate data that is processed by multiple consumers.
   - **Example:** Task queue system with multiple clients submitting tasks to be processed by a pool of workers.
   - **Link to Code:** [task_queue_system.go](https://github.com/deepakmehta1/go-lookup/blob/main/concurrency/patterns/task_queue_system.go)
